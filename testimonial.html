                        Information and Communication Technology (ICT) refers to the technologies used to manage and communicate information. It encompasses various digital tools, networks, and systems that enable the storage, retrieval, processing, and transmission of data. ICT is crucial because it facilitates efficient communication, enhances productivity, streamlines business operations, and enables innovation and collaboration in various sectors.
ALS collaborate with NBSC through this training “Empowering Community ALS Implementers through Digital Citizenship” by helping us (CAI) to be more knowledgeable about ICT. We tackled about computer hardware and software, troubleshooting basic problem of a computer, spreadsheet application, applying arithmetic formula and function, logical and arithmetic function, presentation software application and creating a simple web page. CSS department provided us the environment that we needed through out this training for us to be productive and also a very kind and understanding instructors. Without them and this opportunity we will be struggling in handling this some topic in LS 6 to our learners.
There is struggle we have encounter but instructors help us from day 1 to the end of this training. As for me, I am not as good as the others when it comes to multimedia that is why to be active on this training I need to participate actively. Sometimes I can’t clearly understand the topic because the instructor discussed it swiftly, especially the topic “creating a simple web page”. This topic is the hardest I guess creating web page is not joke. During that time, I really asking to discussed it slowly.
I have learned from this training as a teacher we really do apply the continuous learning, we need to be productive. Through this Empowering Community ALS Implementers through Digital Citizenship, it enhanced my knowledge about ICT.
